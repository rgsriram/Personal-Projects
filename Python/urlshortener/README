Tech Stack:
----------
python, django, mongo db and docker

Fetch short url:
---------------
Directly encoding URL to base_62 will lead into problems like reverse engineering, So randomization is introduced here with the of md5sum

1. Finding the md5sum of the given url with salt.
2. Convert into base 62 encoded string. Why base 62 is we have 26 (lower case) + 26 (upper case) + 10 (digits).
3. Taking only 6 digits coz by this we will have 62^6 possible combinations and url needs to short.
4. Short url which is found will be saved in db.

Fetch long url:
---------------
If short url exists in db, it will be return otherwise request will be failed.

Fetch count:
-----------
Count is calculated when the short url is accessed (fetch_url, fetch_urls and redirection)

Clean:
-----
Clean deletes all the entries in db.


Commands:
--------
Run: make begin
Stop: make stop
